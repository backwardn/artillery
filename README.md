Artillery
============

Artillery is a distributed carrier protocol for Bastion.

It contains the modules below:
* `artillery-ddata`: Used for distributed data replication
* `artillery-core`: Contains leader election and epidemic protocol for broadcasting
* `artillery-hierman`: Supervision hierarchy management layer (aka Bastion's core carrier protocol)

We need a logo here. Cannons are shooting from bastions… Maybe… That was just an idea.
